# Model

STIX is a connected graph of nodes and edges. STIX Domain Objects and STIX Cyber-observable Objects define the graph
nodes and STIX relationships (including both external STIX Relationship Objects and embedded relationships) define the
edges. This graph-based language conforms to common analysis approaches and allows for flexible, modular, structured,
and consistent representations of CTI.
