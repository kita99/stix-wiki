# What is STIX?

STIX/TAXII is a global initiative designed to mitigate and prevention of cyber threats. Launched in December 2016 by the
United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the organization is now managed under OASIS, a nonprofit
organization that advances the development, adoption, and convergence of open standards for the Internet.

Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat
intelligence (CTI). STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine-readable
manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and
to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively. STIX is designed to improve many different
capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and
more.

The objects and features added for inclusion in STIX 2.1 represent an iterative approach to fulfilling basic consumer
and producer requirements for CTI sharing. Objects and properties not included in this version of STIX, but deemed
necessary by the community, will be included in future releases.
