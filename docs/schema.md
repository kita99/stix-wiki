# Schema

STIX is a schema that defines a taxonomy of cyber threat intelligence that is represented by the following objects:

## STIX Core Objects

Any SDO, SCO, or SRO.

 
## STIX Domain Objects

Higher Level Intelligence Objects that represent behaviors and constructs that threat analysts would typically create or work with while understanding the threat landscape.


## STIX Cyber-observable Objects

Objects that represent observed facts about a network or host that may be used and related to higher level intelligence to form a more complete understanding of the threat landscape.

 

## STIX Relationship Objects

Objects that connect STIX Domain Objects together, STIX Cyber-observable Objects together, and connect STIX Domain Objects and STIX Cyber-observable Objects together to form a more complete understanding of the threat landscape.

 

## STIX Meta Objects (SMO)

A STIX Object that provides the necessary glue and associated metadata to enrich or extend STIX Core Objects to support user and system workflows.

 

## STIX Bundle Object

An object that provides a wrapper mechanism for packaging arbitrary STIX content together.
